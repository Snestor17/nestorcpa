        <h1>Strategic Tax Planning and Financial Advisory</h1>
        <h2>for business owners and their families</h2>

        <p>I work directly with clients who want clarity, foresight, and thoughtful guidance — not last-minute surprises.</p>

        <p>Most tax problems don’t come from bad preparation. They come from decisions made without seeing the full picture.</p>

        <p>At Nestor Tax & Advisory, I focus on proactive tax planning and strategic financial advisory. My work is centered on helping clients understand the impact of decisions before they are made — whether those decisions involve business structure, compensation, investments, or timing.</p>

        <p>This is not a high-volume practice. I work with a limited number of clients and stay directly involved in every engagement.</p>

        <p>If you want clarity before making decisions, we should talk.</p>

        </br>

        <h3>Why Nestor Tax & Advisory</h3>
        <p>I bring decades of experience as a CPA and advisor.</p>
        <p>My role is not to simply report what already happened — it’s to help clients see what’s coming and plan accordingly.</p>

    <!-- ABOUT -->
    <section id="about" class="hero">
        <h2>Experience, Perspective, and Direct Involvement</h2>
        <p>For more than three decades, I’ve worked with business owners and individuals navigating complex financial and tax decisions.</p>

        <h3>Professional Background</h3>
        <p>I am a Certified Public Accountant with over 30 years of experience advising clients across a wide range of industries and circumstances.</p>

        <h3>What I Do</h3>

        <article>
            <h4>Tax Planning (Not Just Preparation)</h4>
            <p>Tax planning is an ongoing process, not a year-end scramble. I help clients evaluate decisions across multiple years so taxes are managed intentionally, not reactively.</p>
        </article>

        <article>
            <h4>Strategic Financial Advisory</h4>
            <p>For business owners and complex households, I provide CFO-level insight focused on cash flow, structure, and long-term outcomes — without firm layers or handoffs.</p>
        </article>

        <article>
            <h4>Complex Oversight & Coordination</h4>
            <p>I help clients make sense of complexity: multiple entities, real estate activity, changing income, and evolving goals — all viewed as part of one integrated picture.</p>
        </article>

        <h3>How I Work</h3>
        <ul class="list2" style="width:700px;">
            <li>Direct access. Clients work directly with me — no junior staff, no handoffs.</li>
            </br>
            <li>Planning before compliance. Good decisions come first. Compliance follows.</li>
            </br>
            <li>Clear explanations. I explain the “why,” not just the rules, so clients can move forward with confidence.</li>
        </ul>


        <h3>Who I Work With</h3>
        <ul class="list2" style="width:700px;">
            <li>Business owners with growing or multi-entity structures</li>
            </br>
            <li>Individuals and families with complex tax considerations</li>
            </br>
            <li>Real estate owners and investors navigating entity planning, depreciation, and exit decisions</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Why I Work This Way</h3>
        <p>Tax preparation reports what already happened. Advisory work helps shape what happens next.</p>
